# Nazi Hunt
This is the first game project I worked on. I developed this as a course project at Seven Games (no longer exists), if any of the old members is still out there, reach out!

This was originally developed in the XNA framework and it was envisioned as a Beat 'em up Metal Slug-like game. Of course it didn't get nowhere near that.

## Compiling
Nowadays, it was possible to compile and run this again using the [FNA framework](https://fna-xna.github.io/). I had to follow [this tutorial](https://fna-xna.github.io/docs/1%3A-Setting-Up-FNA/) in the docs and I also included the [pre-compiled fnalibs](https://fna.flibitijibibo.com/archive/fnalibs.tar.bz2) for Windows x64 in the project.
To compile the project on different machines/platforms, it will require to change the FNA project paths in the `NaziHunt.csproj` and `NaziHunt.sln` files and also include the platform libraries in the `assets/libs` folder.
